This means that given a candidate solution, we can check in polynomial time whether it is a valid solution to the problem.The other options are incorrect:- 'NP problems can be SOLVED in polynomial time' is false, as the P vs NP problem remains unsolved and it is unknown whether all NP problems can be solved efficiently.- 'NP problems are a strict superset of P problems' is correct, as all P problems are also NP problems, but there may be NP problems that are not in P.- 'NP problems are a strict subset of P problems' is false, as P is a subset of NP (P \u2286 NP).",

This means that if a solution to an NP problem is provided, it can be checked for correctness in polynomial time.However, it is not known whether NP problems can be SOLVED in polynomial time by a deterministic Turing machine. This is the famous P vs NP problem, one of the biggest open questions in computer science.Option A is incorrect because it states that NP problems can be solved in polynomial time, which is the defining characteristic of the P complexity class, not NP.Option B is correct - this accurately describes the defining property of NP problems.Option C is incorrect because it states that NP problems can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine, which is the defining characteristic of the NPTIME complexity class, not NP.Option D is incorrect because it conflates the properties of NP and NPTIME - NP problems can be verified in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine, but NPTIME problems can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic Turing machine.",
